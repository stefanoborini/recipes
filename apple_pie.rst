- 100g butter
- 80g sugar
- 16g baking powder

Remove the skin from the apples, then cut in thin slices. Put them into a container with some grated lemon skin or aroma, and cinnamon.
Leave for a while. In the meantime, put raisin in hot water for 10-15 minutes.

Whisk softened butter with sugar. When soft, add the eggs one after another, whisking in between to create a uniform mixture.
Add flour slowly and baking powder, mixing. Put half of the apples in the mixture, most of the pine nuts and of the raisins. Keep some for 
decoration.

Add some butter in a cake pan (24 cm) and some flour to prevent sticking. Pour the mixture and add the remaining apples from the center in a spiral.
